Tips for first time users of mac moving from windows

## To login:
- Ctl Alt Del is not available. Just open the laptop to get the login screen. If it’s in sleep mode, swipe or click the touchpad and login prompt will come up. To lock the screen use Command-Ctrl-Q

## Keyboard:
- In Mac, there is no equivalent of “delete” key in windows. The “delete” key you see on the Mac keyboard is actually the equivalent of “backspace” 

## Trackpad:
- Equivalent of mouse Left click - click on left bottom corner
- Equivalent of mouse right click - click  anywhere with 2 fingers
Now these could be customised by going to System Preferences-> Trackpad

## System preferences and other system menu items
- Click on the apple logo on top left corner of the desktop on the system menu bar. Select 'system preferences'
- Other options such as sleep, restart, shutdown, lock etc. also available there. For whichever menu item that supports a keyboard shortcut, the shortcut is listed along with the menu item 

## Windows and menus
- The menu for an app is not part of the app's window, but it will appear at the top of the screen as system menu. That menu keeps changing based on the app in focus. The app's window only has the 'close, minimize and maximize' buttons on top left corner by default. Now some apps may choose to have a menu bar or a tool bar etc at the top of their window, but that is not default.

## File explorer and search:
- There is no file explorer. It is called ‘finder’
- Some of the app icons including finder may be on the desktop screen. If not found then click on the search icon on right hand top , and type in ‘finder’ and it will show up in the result. Double click to launch it(same for any other app) 
- The search feature accessible via this icon on top right of the screen is called the 'spotlight' feature. This is the one stop search for the whole computer. It will search across the computer and apps for the keyword and bring up results listed in different categories 
- Finder also has it's own search feature available as a search box on top right corner of the finder window. To search for items in file system this can be used
- By default the home folder for a user is "/Users/<username>". There is a bunch of default folders we will find under that such as Applications, Documents, Downloads, Movies, Pictures etc. When you open Finder you would find shortcuts to these folders in the left panel
- By default Finder may not show the hard drive root or not even the user home folder in the left panel
