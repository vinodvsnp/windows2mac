Tips for first time users of mac moving from windows

## Setting up
- Follow the instructions

- You can choose 'setup later" option for items like Siri, apple id etc., so that you can get setup faster. You can later setup apple id, siri and other  options

## To login:
- Ctl-Alt-Del is not available. Just open the laptop to get the login screen. If it’s in sleep mode, swipe or click the touchpad and login prompt will come up. To lock the screen use Command-Ctrl-Q

## Wi-Fi
- A typical Wi-Fi icon can be found on top right part of the screen

- The Wi-Fi icon will have active stripes if Wi-Fi is on and connected. I will be blank just with an outline if not connected, and you will see the stripes animated if Wi-Fi is on and it is looking to connect to some network

- Click on the Wi-Fi icon to see the list of available networks. Clicking on it will refresh the list. There will be a tick-mark against the currenrly connected network. You can click on another network from the list if you want to change the connection. It will prompt for password if applicable and then connect 

- At the end of that list you will see other menu options including a menu item "Open network preferences" which is the "Network settings"

- You can also reach "Network preferences" by clicking on the System menu (apple logo on top left corner of the screen) and then choosing "System Preferences-> Network"

## Keyboard and short-cuts:
- In Mac, there is no equivalent of “delete” key in windows. The “delete” key you see on the Mac keyboard is actually the equivalent of “backspace” 

- Copy is  command-C instead of Ctrl-C in Windows (works also for copying files in Finder app)
- Paste is command-V instead of Ctrl-V in Windows (works also for copying files in Finder app)
- Move is option-command-V after doing a command-C instead of Ctrl-X and then Ctrl-Y in Windows (this is for files in Finder app)
- Cut is command-X instead of Ctrl-X in Windows (DOES NOT work for cutting files in Finder app)
- Undo is commad-Z instead of Ctrl-Z
- Redo is command-shift-Z instead of Ctrl-Y
- Page down is option-down arrow and Page up is option-up arrow
- Do command-down arrow or command-up arrow to go all the way down or up
- To navigate word by word to left or right, use option-left arrow or option-right arrow 
- To navigate all the way to the left or right ends of a line use command-left arrow or command-right arrow

A whole set of keyboard shortcuts are available at [apple support site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236)

## Trackpad:
- Equivalent of mouse Left click - click on left bottom corner
- Equivalent of mouse right click - click  anywhere with 2 fingers
Now these could be customised by going to System Preferences-> Trackpad

## System preferences and other system menu items
- Click on the apple logo on top left corner of the desktop on the system menu bar. Select 'system preferences'
- Other options such as sleep, restart, shutdown, lock etc. also available there. For whichever menu item that supports a keyboard shortcut, the shortcut is listed along with the menu item 

## Windows and menus
- The close, minimize, maximize buttons for a window are found on the top left corner as 3 colored dots - red (close), yellow(minimize) and green (maximize), instead of sqare buttons on right top corner in Windows

- The application menu for an app is not part of the app's window, but it will appear at the top of the screen as system menu. That system menu keeps changing based on the app in focus. The app's window at the basic level only has the 'close, minimize and maximize' buttons on top left corner by default. Now some apps may choose to have a menu bar or a tool bar etc at the top of their window, but that is not default.

- **Switching between windows**
  * To switch between application windows use "command-tab" instead of "alt-tab" in Windows.
  * To swicth between windows of same application (say different safari windows or different Finder windows) use "Command-tilde" (Command-`) 

## Web browsing and web search
- The default web browser in Mac is 'Safari'. You can either click on the compass looking icon in the menu bar at the bottom of the desktop screen, or use the search button on top right corner of the screen to search for "safar" and select the safari app from the results, or in Finder go to 'Applications' folder and double click Safari from that folder.

- You can use Safari to browse and download other browsers of your choice

- Safari uses google search by default. You can type in your search words in the address bar of safari and directly get google search results

## File explorer and search:
- There is no file explorer. It is called ‘finder’
- Some of the app icons including finder may be on the desktop screen. If not found then click on the search icon on right hand top , and type in ‘finder’ and it will show up in the result. Double click to launch it(same for any other app) 
- The search feature accessible via this icon on top right of the screen is called the 'spotlight' feature. This is the one stop search for the whole computer. It will search across the computer and apps for the keyword and bring up results listed in different categories 
- Finder also has it's own search feature available as a search box on top right corner of the finder window. To search for items in file system this can be used
- By default the home folder for a user is "/Users/<username>". There is a bunch of default folders we will find under that such as Applications, Documents, Downloads, Movies, Pictures etc. When you open Finder you would find shortcuts to these folders in the left panel
- By default Finder may not show the hard drive root or not even the user home folder in the left panel
 
 ## Installing application software
 Go to the web location of the application's downloads, choose the download for Mac and get it downloaded. Typically it will be either a dmg file or a pkg file. By default they will download to the Downloads folder
 
 - In case it is a dmg file, double click on the file. It will open a small Finder window in which you will see the dmg file and applciations folder. Drag the dmg into the applications folder. Now application is available to be started either by going to applications folder via Finder or by seearching via spotlight (the search icon on top right corner of screen)
 
 - In case it is a pkg file, double click on the file. It will launch an installer and guide you through the installation. In some cases it will ask for admin privileges by popping a system window that takes a username with admin privilege and password. Supply the user/ password with admin privilege only if you trust this app to use the privilege properly
